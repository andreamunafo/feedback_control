## Course coordinator

## Lecturer(s)

## Install

The notebooks run with python 3.9 and use the following python
libraries: - sympy - python control - numpy - pandas - matplotlib -
opencv-python

Notebook `01_Getting_started_with_Python_and_Jupyter_Notebook.ipynb`
provides a short introduction on how to set up an anaconda environment
to get you started.

To use all notebooks you might need to install the feedback control
package. You can do this entering this into your terminal:

    pip install -e '.[dev]'

This is the recommended way to make a Python package importable from
anywhere in your current environment:

- `-e` – short for “editable”, lets you immediately use changes made to
  your package during development.
- `.` – refers to the current directory.
- `[dev]` – includes “development” requirements: other packages that
  your notebooks use solely for documentation or testing.

## How to use

Each notebook is thought to be independent from every other, so it is
possible to run them in any order you prefer.
